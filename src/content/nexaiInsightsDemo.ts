export const NEXAI_INSIGHTS_DEMO_MARKDOWN = "⚠️ Critical Observation: Before we dive in, we noticed this attempt appears to be a system test or a \"speed run.\"\n\nTotal Duration: 90 seconds (Standard CAT duration is 120 minutes).\n\nAverage Time Per Question: ~1-3 seconds.\n\nBehavior: It seems options were clicked randomly to test the submission flow.\n\nBecause of this, the Behavioral Insights below (such as Time Management and Panic Switching) are illustrative examples of how NexAI analyzes your performance, rather than a genuine reflection of your current ability.\n\n📊 Executive Summary\nTotal Score: 14 / 198\n\nOverall Accuracy: 35% (7 Correct / 20 Attempted)\n\nGlobal Rank: N/A (Insufficient peer data)\n\nPrimary Issue: Selectivity. You attempted 20 questions in just 90 seconds, indicating a \"Spray and Pray\" approach rather than strategic selection.\n\n1. Sectional Deep Dive\nVARC (Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension)\nScore: 10 (Highest performing section)\n\nAccuracy: 44% (4/9)\n\nTopic Analysis:\n\n✅ Strength: Inference and Detail Identification. You correctly identified specific details in the \"Netflix/Europe\" passage.\n\n❌ Weakness: Logical Weakening and Para Jumbles. You consistently struggled with questions requiring structural logic or undermining arguments.\n\nNexAI Insight: You are currently better at Retrieval (finding facts) than Reasoning (analyzing arguments). Recommendation: Practice \"Critical Reasoning\" sets to improve your understanding of logical structures.\n\nDILR (Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning)\nScore: 1\n\nAccuracy: 20% (1/5)\n\nSet Performance:\n\nMetro Services (Puzzles - Grid): 0/1 Correct. You struggled with the grid optimization problem.\n\nScheduling (Rides): 1/4 Correct. You got the \"Rides completed by 2:00 PM\" question correct but missed the calculation-heavy questions regarding total spend.\n\nNexAI Insight: You attempted questions from two very different sets. In a real exam, splitting your focus between sets often leads to zero yield. Recommendation: Focus on completely solving one set before moving to the next.\n\nQA (Quantitative Ability)\nScore: 3\n\nAccuracy: 33% (2/6)\n\nTopic Analysis:\n\n✅ Strength: Relative Speed and Sequences/AP. You showed promise in these procedural topics.\n\n❌ Weakness: Number Theory and Inequalities. Conceptual topics were incorrect.\n\nNexAI Insight: You got the \"Relative Speed\" question correct in 1 second, which is statistically impossible without guessing.\n\n2. Advanced Analytics (The \"Value Add\" Layers)\nNexAI computes these High-Value Metrics to give you actionable insights:\n\nA. The \"Time-ROI\" Index\nDefinition: Points earned per minute spent.\n\nYour Data:\n\nVARC: 20 Points/Min (Excellent, though effectively guessing).\n\nQA: 15 Points/Min.\n\nGoal: Identifying \"Time Sinks.\"\n\nExample Analysis: \"You spent 5 minutes on a Geometry question but got it wrong. That time could have been used to solve 3 Arithmetic questions.\"\n\nB. The \"Snipe Rate\" (Accuracy vs. Difficulty)\nDefinition: How accurate are you on \"Easy\" vs. \"Hard\" questions?\n\nYour Data:\n\nHard Questions: 1/9 Correct (11%).\n\nMedium Questions: 5/8 Correct (62.5%).\n\nActionable Advice: Stop fighting \"Hard\" questions. Your accuracy on \"Medium\" questions is significantly higher. If you had skipped the 9 Hard questions you attempted, your negative marks would have dropped, and your overall score would have increased.\n\nC. The \"Guessing Detector\"\nLogic: Detecting questions answered too quickly with incorrect results.\n\nYour Data: Almost every question here triggered this flag.\n\nNexAI Observation: We noticed you answered 15 questions in under 5 seconds each. Were you short on time, or just testing the buttons?\n\nD. The \"Review Efficiency\" Metric\nDefinition: Analysis of how you use the review tools and revisit questions.\n\nYour Data:\n\nQuestion 8 (VARC): You visited this twice but still got it incorrect.\n\nQuestion 9 (VARC): You visited this three times and got it correct.\n\nNexAI Insight: When you revisit a question (like Q9), your accuracy improves. However, you rarely use the \"Mark for Review\" feature. You should use the 'Mark for Review' button more aggressively, especially for TITA (Type In The Answer) questions, to build a bank of solvable questions for the end of the section.";
