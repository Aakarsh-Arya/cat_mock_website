⚠️ Critical Observation: Before we dive in, we noticed this attempt appears to be a system test or a "speed run."

Total Duration: 90 seconds (Standard CAT duration is 120 minutes).

Average Time Per Question: ~1-3 seconds.

Behavior: It seems options were clicked randomly to test the submission flow.

Because of this, the Behavioral Insights below (such as Time Management and Panic Switching) are illustrative examples of how NexAI analyzes your performance, rather than a genuine reflection of your current ability.

📊 Executive Summary
Total Score: 14 / 198

Overall Accuracy: 35% (7 Correct / 20 Attempted)

Global Rank: N/A (Insufficient peer data)

Primary Issue: Selectivity. You attempted 20 questions in just 90 seconds, indicating a "Spray and Pray" approach rather than strategic selection.

1. Sectional Deep Dive
VARC (Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension)
Score: 10 (Highest performing section)

Accuracy: 44% (4/9)

Topic Analysis:

✅ Strength: Inference and Detail Identification. You correctly identified specific details in the "Netflix/Europe" passage.

❌ Weakness: Logical Weakening and Para Jumbles. You consistently struggled with questions requiring structural logic or undermining arguments.

NexAI Insight: You are currently better at Retrieval (finding facts) than Reasoning (analyzing arguments). Recommendation: Practice "Critical Reasoning" sets to improve your understanding of logical structures.

DILR (Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning)
Score: 1

Accuracy: 20% (1/5)

Set Performance:

Metro Services (Puzzles - Grid): 0/1 Correct. You struggled with the grid optimization problem.

Scheduling (Rides): 1/4 Correct. You got the "Rides completed by 2:00 PM" question correct but missed the calculation-heavy questions regarding total spend.

NexAI Insight: You attempted questions from two very different sets. In a real exam, splitting your focus between sets often leads to zero yield. Recommendation: Focus on completely solving one set before moving to the next.

QA (Quantitative Ability)
Score: 3

Accuracy: 33% (2/6)

Topic Analysis:

✅ Strength: Relative Speed and Sequences/AP. You showed promise in these procedural topics.

❌ Weakness: Number Theory and Inequalities. Conceptual topics were incorrect.

NexAI Insight: You got the "Relative Speed" question correct in 1 second, which is statistically impossible without guessing.

2. Advanced Analytics (The "Value Add" Layers)
NexAI computes these High-Value Metrics to give you actionable insights:

A. The "Time-ROI" Index
Definition: Points earned per minute spent.

Your Data:

VARC: 20 Points/Min (Excellent, though effectively guessing).

QA: 15 Points/Min.

Goal: Identifying "Time Sinks."

Example Analysis: "You spent 5 minutes on a Geometry question but got it wrong. That time could have been used to solve 3 Arithmetic questions."

B. The "Snipe Rate" (Accuracy vs. Difficulty)
Definition: How accurate are you on "Easy" vs. "Hard" questions?

Your Data:

Hard Questions: 1/9 Correct (11%).

Medium Questions: 5/8 Correct (62.5%).

Actionable Advice: Stop fighting "Hard" questions. Your accuracy on "Medium" questions is significantly higher. If you had skipped the 9 Hard questions you attempted, your negative marks would have dropped, and your overall score would have increased.

C. The "Guessing Detector"
Logic: Detecting questions answered too quickly with incorrect results.

Your Data: Almost every question here triggered this flag.

NexAI Observation: We noticed you answered 15 questions in under 5 seconds each. Were you short on time, or just testing the buttons?

D. The "Review Efficiency" Metric
Definition: Analysis of how you use the review tools and revisit questions.

Your Data:

Question 8 (VARC): You visited this twice but still got it incorrect.

Question 9 (VARC): You visited this three times and got it correct.

NexAI Insight: When you revisit a question (like Q9), your accuracy improves. However, you rarely use the "Mark for Review" feature. You should use the 'Mark for Review' button more aggressively, especially for TITA (Type In The Answer) questions, to build a bank of solvable questions for the end of the section.
